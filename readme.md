# Simple game tool(temp name)

This project is a very basic game creation tool built around custom stack programming language. This project is meant to make it easier to create portable non-platform dependent games using language and engine built specifically for creating games.

### About the language and engine

Although this project slowly changed to be more capable, it originally just started as "can i do it?" for making a clone for ClickTeam fusion 2.5 after i tried to learn how to use it and was met with the worst programming-language-tool-thing i have seen in a while. The idea of this language is to both be very reliable and also be designed around specifically this engine and specifically making games, instead of adopting or even creating a general purpose language and then attempt to fit it into the project.

Although I do intend to _at least try_ to make this into a somewhat usable simple game engine, possibly even with a custom editor, this project is largely a testing ground for implementing various features that i struggled to implement in GobLang
